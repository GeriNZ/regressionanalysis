# Bike Sharing Assignment
> Project by Géraldine Bengsch (First Upgrad case study) <br>
>
> This project uses Regression Analysis to build a multiple linear regression model for the prediction of demand for shared bikes:
> - Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes
> - How well the variables describe the bike demands
>
> The project contains:
> - Data Analysis notebook
> - A folder containing images used (Visualisations are our own, picture is from Unsplash)
> - The data set `day.csv`
> - The data dictionary `Readme.txt`

- **General information:** 
A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario

- **Background:** 
A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.

- **Business problem:**
Aim is to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations.

- **Dataset:** The dataset consists of 111 columns and 39717 entries. Not all columns contain data, with a total number of 2263364 missing entries. Based on our exploration, the Lending Club data is similar to other data that may be obtained through other financial companies. The data set was provided to us through *UpGrad*. However, it is also available publicly.



## Conclusions
Please see the notebook and Presentation slides for more detailed insights.
1. Purpose of the loan  does not matter. 
2. Borrowers were **more likely to default on their loans if interest rates at time of borrowing were high**. 
3. Borrowers are **more likely to default when term was 60 months and they were below Grade B**. 
4. The amount of funds provided by investors is an import factor, as those whose who were **able to pay off fully had help from investors**.
5. **Annual income is not an indicator** of whether the loan will be paid.
